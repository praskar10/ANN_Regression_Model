# ANN_Regression_Model
Building an ANN Regression Model to Predict Electrical Energy Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant.


The dataset comprises 9568 data points gathered from a Combined Cycle Power Plant in operation at full capacity for six years (2006-2011). The features include hourly averages of ambient variables such as Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), and Exhaust Vacuum (V), which can help predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the power plant.

A power plant that operates on a combined cycle (CCPP) consists of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST), and heat recovery steam generators. This type of power plant generates electricity by using both gas and steam turbines, which work together in a cycle and transfer energy from one turbine to the other.
